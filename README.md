# Google Hash Code Solutions
In this repo I gradually add my solutions to various google hash code tasks I solved throughout the years. You can find the original problem statements and input data [here](https://codingcompetitions.withgoogle.com/hashcode/archive).

# Results on original instances
* Pizza Warm-Up: With an area choice of 15x15, the pizza is cut quite decent with 49987/50000 on medium and 965521/1000000 on big.
* (2014) Street View Routing: The pruned bfs yields 1930138, outperforming the on-site scores.
* (2015) Optimize a data center: The result of 390 is a top 15 place regarding the on-site scores.
* (2016) Drone delivery: The algorithm gives a score of ~273100, which would have been enough to get into the finals.
* (2017) Streaming Videos: This solution would have placed you 21st in the qualifications. Back then, I got into 50th with AG Global Opt :) (using a Knapsack for populating every cache server one after another)
